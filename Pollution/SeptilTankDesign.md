  #### Tree Design
  
        1. Which Tree? 
            - Trees that are thirsty for water and rapid growth.
            - Trees that are known to survive.
            - Trees whose fruits should not be consumed by humans.
        2. Best Choice.
             - Nilgiri Tree.
                 Very Thirsty tree. Known as water guzzler.
                 Grows very fast.
                 The final tree can be cut down and used as firewood. Highly flammable.
